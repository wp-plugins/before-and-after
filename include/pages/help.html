		<h3>Introduction: How Does This Plugin Work?</h3>
		<p>Before & After is a lead capture plugin that lets you offer your users something in exchange for their information. It can also be when you need to make sure your users read your Terms of Service, verify their age before entering your website, or otherwise need to see one thing, and then another.</p>

		<p>To achieve this, Before & After uses what we call goals. A goal is simply an action, or a "gate", that your users need to pass before they will be allowed to see your protected content.</p>

		<p>A user completes a Goal by simply encountering the [complete_goal] shortcode. You will have placed it on your Thank You page, on the terms page, or whatever other page you need the user to view to signify that they have completed the goal.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="setup_a_new_goal"><h3>How To Setup A New Goal</h3>
		<p>To create a new Goal, simply follow these steps:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Under the Before & After menu, select Goals. This will bring up a page which lists all of your goals.</li>
			<li>Click the "Add A New Goal" button</li>
			<li>Give your Goal a title, and then fill out the Before & After sections. When you are done, click the Publish button.</li>
			<li>Your goal has been created! Copy the [goal] shortcode from the Edit Goal screen you are currently viewing, and go paste it onto the on which page you'd like the goal to appear.</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<div id="complete_a_goal">
		<h3>How To Have A Visitor Complete A Goal</h3>
		<p>Simply add a shortcode like this to the final step of your goal funnel. For example, you could place it on the "Thank You" page from a contact form.</p>

		&#91;complete_goal id="82"]

		<p><em>(Replace the number 82 with the id of your goal. Tip: you can find the shortcode for each goal on the Goals page.)</em></p>
	</div>
	<div id="shortcode_reference">
		<h3>Shortcode Reference</h3>
